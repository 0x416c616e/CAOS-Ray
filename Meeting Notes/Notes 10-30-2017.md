## Ray Tracer Project
* Less about ray tracing and more about the group project aspect
* Dr. Bouvier will contribute no code, it will be up to the people in the group itself.
* Programming language for the ray tracer: Java
* Name: C(H)AOS Ray(?)
* DON'T look up ray tracer programming projects on GitHub because we don't want to get too ahead or just copy some other project
* Goals for ray tracer deadlines: *???*
* Time scale: there is no end
* License: revisit, research different licenses (Apache 2.0, MIT, GPL, BSD, etc)
* Repo: GitHub
* We should have a blog or site
  * Dev blog
  * GitHub Pages?

---

## TO-DO
  * Start GitHub Project
    1. Name
    2. README.md
      * Java (version?)
      * Meeting date/time
      * IRC and Slack info
    3. CONTRIBUTING.md
      * Code review process
      * General "how to contribute" (fork, branch, pull request)
      * Testing
    4. Slack stuff
    5. IRC channel (Steve)

## About Ray Tracers

### Lighting and Shading
  * Observe
  * Refracting
    * Light bounces off stuff
  * Reflecting and refracting
  * Inter-object interactions
  * O(N^N) complexity
  * Interaction of color of light between objects
  * Light and color
    * Something with no color will just reflect the light back (no change)

### Reflections
  * Diffuse reflection
  * Texture
  * Specular reflection
  * Specular and diffuse together

### Ray Tracing Says the Viewer Is Somewhere
  * Instead of light coming at the light source, figure out what light arrives at the viewer

### Components
  * Camera
  * Image
  * View ray
  * Light source
  * Shadow ray
  * Scene object

### Miscellaneous Ray Tracer Info
  * Querying the scene: "what is here?"
  * How many times you bounce the light rays is up to the programmer, like how much power you want to require for it (minimum system requirements, how long it takes to render, CPU usage)
  * Ray tracer has input and output
      * Input:
        * Scene description
        * Where are objects
      * Output:
        * Image file
  * Ray tracing spheres because they're easier
    * Add other shapes later?

### Group

### Open Source
* OpenStack example
* Get involved with a project, such as an open source project, maybe something on GitHub. Work on something you have no obligation to work on, work in a group, etc.
  * Looks good on a resume to have an open source or otherwise non-class project
* "All developers speak one language, the code you write"
* Open source software and teaming
* Most of the time with FOSS you're starting with something someone else made, not starting from scratch
* Figure out which small piece of it you can understand, modify, improve
* Reading and contributing documents
  * Documentation is important but often an afterthought.
  * Write it and make sure there is supporting documentation for people to contribute but also so people can read about how to use it.

### Testing
* Travis CI Integration for GitHub, Unit and Integration Testing
* Reviews: code reviews for pull requests
  * 3 people need to review something before it gets accepted. You should not review stuff that you yourself submitted (self-merging code is bad).
  * You can review your own code but your vote doesn't count. Author can't vote or merge.
  * Merges: merge after 3+1 votes, merge with rebase

### Communication
* New Slack caos-oss channel on eHacks
* IRC is important for group open source projects because there are some projects that won't use Slack
* Slack also has some limitations about messages
* Friday is Slack/IRC
* Need to install IRC clients
* Slack
* IRC, on freenode
  * #SIUE-ray
  * ZNC (IRC bouncer)

## Next Meeting and Homework
* Meet again next week: **4:30pm EB1140(?)** -- check Slack to make sure
* Next week: learn more about ray tracers from Dr. Bouvier, figure out how to split up the project into groups with other people (not Dr. Bouvier)
* Homework for next time: come up with names
* Brush up on Java, make sure you can compile and whatnot
* Figure out which tools we will use.
* Join IRC
